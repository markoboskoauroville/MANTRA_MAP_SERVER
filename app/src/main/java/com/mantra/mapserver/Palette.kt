 * Baba, 14.9.2026: *"all these buttons, they cover the map because they have black behind them.
 * Make transparent background. Let's say 50%."* So every panel and every key is the near-black
 * ground at half strength: the map reads through it, and the text still reads against it because
 * sand on half-black clears the contrast floor with room to spare.
 *
 * Colour is still the only state channel. Amber is the lit thing, sand is ink, red is recording
 * and real faults, and nothing else carries a hue.
