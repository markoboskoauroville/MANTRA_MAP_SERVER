/**
 * FETCHING A REGION, WITH THE PERSON WATCHING IT HAPPEN.
 *
 * 176 MB is minutes on a phone signal, and download-monitor.md's rule is that nothing longer than
 * a minute happens in the dark: the size is said before it starts, the progress is a number while
 * it runs, and a failure says what failed rather than leaving a button that did nothing.
 *
 * IT RESUMES. A half-finished file is kept as `.part` and the next attempt asks the server for
 * the rest with a Range header. Somebody on a mountain road loses the signal at 80% once, and
 * starting again from zero is how an app gets deleted.
 *
 * THE FILE IS ONLY RENAMED WHEN IT IS WHOLE. A `.map` of the right name and the wrong length is
 * the worst outcome: mapsforge opens it, draws part of a country, and nothing says why.
